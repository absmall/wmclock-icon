|O|  Installing wmclock  |X|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The procedure for installing wmclock is relatively simple; it depends
on imake, which ships with most systems which include the X Window
System.

  (1) Run the `configure' script to configure the language support that
      is built into wmclock.  For example:
      
          ./configure --lang english

      For a list of the available languages, use:
      
          ./configure --help

      The configure script also creates a Makefile out of the Imakefile
      using xmkmf.

  (2) Compile:
  
          make

      You may specify the C compiler to use and additional command-line
      options for the C compiler using the `CC' and `CDEBUGFLAGS'
      variables, respectively.  For example:
      
          make CC=clang CDEBUGFLAGS='-O4 -march=pentium2'


  (3) Test wmclock:
  
          ./wmclock

      (If it appears to work as expected, *don't dock it*.  Wait until
      after you've installed it).

  (4) Install:
  
          su
          make install
	  make install.man

      Optionally, install all the month and weekday pixmaps for use
      with the `-monthxpm' and `-weekdayxpm' options:
      
          make install.share

  (5) You're done.  See the README file accompanying this one for
      instructions on installing wmclock into Window Maker's dock.
